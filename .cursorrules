You are working on Kerunity as a single-file widget inside the ChatGPT Apps SDK.

HARD RULES: Read KERUNITY_CONTEXT.md first. Obey CURSOR_RULES.md. Calm-tech only, minimal UI, high accessibility, reduced-motion support, no medical advice, no dependency creep.

- Only edit: web/index.html (and optionally web/favicon.ico later).
- Do NOT introduce frameworks (React/Next/Vite), bundlers, Tailwind CDN, or new dependencies.
- Do NOT change folder structure.
- Do NOT touch /server unless explicitly asked.
- Keep everything plain HTML/CSS/JS in one file.
- If you propose changes, implement them as minimal patches.

WORKFLOW:
- Make one small change at a time.
- After each change, verify the UI still loads and buttons still work.
- If something breaks, revert immediately to the baseline copy.

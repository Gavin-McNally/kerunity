You are working on Kerunity, a crisis-support PWA for carers.

FIRST: Read KERUNITY_SPEC.md — it is the single source of truth.

HARD RULES:
- Obey CURSOR_RULES.md
- Calm-tech only, minimal UI, high accessibility
- Reduced-motion support required
- No medical advice, no clinical tone
- No dependency creep
- Use "Kerunity" (not "KerUnity")

DESIGN PRIORITY (strict order):
1. Safety
2. Clarity  
3. Predictability
4. Accessibility
5. Visual calm

DO NOT:
- Reduce font sizes or weights
- Reduce touch targets
- Remove safety guards (disclaimers, confirmations, exit routes)
- Introduce frameworks (React/Next/Vite), bundlers, or new dependencies
- Add decorative motion or animation
- Change folder structure without permission

ONLY EDIT:
- web/index.html (main app)
- web/manifest.json (PWA config)
- web/sw.js (service worker)
- web/*.png (icons)

WORKFLOW:
- Make one small change at a time
- After each change, verify UI still loads and all buttons work
- If something breaks, revert immediately
- If unsure, propose options with tradeoffs — don't guess silently

GOLDEN RULE:
If a change does not help a stressed carer in a difficult moment, it does not belong.

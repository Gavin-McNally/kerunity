## About Kerunity

**Headline:** Crisis support for carers, when you need it most.

**Body:**

Kerunity helps family carers supporting someone with dementia or cognitive decline. When a difficult moment happens — at 3am, in the middle of a meltdown, when you don't know what to say — this app gives you words that work.

**What we offer:**
- Practical scripts for real situations
- Words you can say out loud, right now
- Works completely offline — no internet needed

**Who we are:**

Kerunity was built by a carer, for carers. We know the loneliness of these moments. We know the guilt when things go wrong. And we know that sometimes, you just need someone to tell you what to say.

You're doing harder work than most people will ever understand. This app is here to help.

---

## How to Use

**Headline:** Get help in three taps.

**Tap a situation. Read the words. That's it.**

Everything else is optional.

---

### Want more detail?

**🎧 Tap "Listen"**  
Hear the script read aloud. Helpful when you're too stressed to read, or when you want to focus on the person you're caring for.

**👆 Use the feedback buttons**  
After each script, we ask "How does it feel now?" This helps you navigate to more support if the situation is getting worse. Your answer stays on your device — we never see it.

**📱 Works offline**  
Once installed, your phone can be in airplane mode. This is crisis infrastructure, not a cloud service.

## Privacy

**Headline:** Your privacy isn't a setting. It's how we built this.

**The short version:**  
Kerunity collects nothing. We store nothing. We track nothing. We can't see what you do in this app because we deliberately built it that way.

**How it works:**

- **100% offline** — The app runs entirely on your device. No servers. No accounts. No internet required after installation.

- **No analytics** — We don't use Google Analytics, Facebook pixels, or any tracking code. We have no idea how many people use this app or what they tap on.

- **No accounts** — You don't sign up. You don't log in. There's nothing to hack because there's nothing stored.

- **No data collection** — We don't collect your location, your contacts, your usage patterns, or anything else. The app literally cannot send data because it doesn't connect to anything.

---

**Why we built it this way:**

Caring for someone is intimate and exhausting. The last thing you need is another app harvesting your struggles for ad targeting. 

We believe privacy should be structural, not a promise. You shouldn't have to trust us — you should be able to verify that we *can't* access your data, even if we wanted to.

---

**Why most apps can't make this promise:**

Other crisis apps require accounts, track your usage, or sync data to the cloud. They'll say they "take privacy seriously" — but their architecture requires knowing who you are and what you do.

We chose the harder path: building an app that literally cannot spy on you. No servers to hack. No database to leak. No company to sell your data to.

**This isn't a better privacy policy. It's a different architecture.**

---

**What happens if you reinstall:**

Because Kerunity stores nothing on servers, reinstalling the app means starting fresh. There's no account to recover because there was never an account.

This is by design. Your crisis moments disappear with the app.

---

**Third-party services:**  
This app contains no third-party SDKs, advertising frameworks, or external services. What you download is what you get.

---

**GDPR Compliance:**

Kerunity processes no personal data. When you contact us via email or WhatsApp, that communication is handled by those services (Google, Meta) under their privacy policies.

If you donate via Ko-fi or Buy Me a Coffee, payment processing is handled by those services under their terms. We never see your payment information.

---

## Emergency Contacts

**Headline:** If someone is in immediate danger, get help now.

### Bottom Note (All Regions)

**If you're struggling:**

Exhaustion, burnout, feeling like you can't cope — that's not weakness. That's what happens when someone does an impossible job for too long.

The crisis lines above support carers too, not just the person you're caring for. Please reach out.

---

## Important Notice

**Headline:** Please read this.

**This app provides guidance, not medical advice.**

Kerunity offers practical scripts and de-escalation techniques based on established dementia care approaches. It is not a substitute for professional medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.

**When to seek professional help:**

- If the person you're caring for shows sudden changes in behaviour, confusion, or consciousness
- If you're concerned about medication, symptoms, or their physical health
- If you're unsure whether a situation is a medical emergency

**When in doubt, call NHS 111 or 999.**

---

**Content review:**

Every script in Kerunity has been reviewed by dementia care professionals. However, we cannot guarantee outcomes. Every person with dementia is different, and what works in one situation may not work in another.

---

**Your judgement matters:**

You know the person you're caring for. The scripts in this app are starting points, not rules. If something doesn't feel right for your situation, trust yourself.

---

**The limits of what an app can do:**

Kerunity can help you find words in a difficult moment. It cannot replace human support — from professionals, from family, from your community. Please don't carry this alone.

---

**Age guidance:**

Kerunity is designed for adult family carers. While there's nothing inappropriate in the content, the emotional weight of the situations described may be distressing for children.

---

**Accuracy:**

We've done our best to ensure the information in this app is helpful and accurate based on current dementia care best practices. If you notice something that seems wrong or harmful, please tell us immediately: gavin@kerunity.app

---

## Our Story

**Headline:** Built by a carer. Named for my partner.

**Body:**

I'm a carer for my Mum. She's had MS for over 40 years, and now in her 70s, she's started experiencing cognitive decline. Missed appointments. Forgotten conversations. The kind of thing where she'll be on the phone booking something and write down the wrong time because she's already forgotten.

The tools that are supposed to help — Alexa, calendars, reminders — don't work for her. By the time she sees the reminder, she can't remember what it's for.

I started building tools to help her. But while researching cognitive decline, I found the research on dementia carers. And I realised: what we're dealing with is minor compared to what they face. The 3am moments. The aggression. The grief of losing someone who's still there.

That's when I knew I had to build this first. Not because my situation is the hardest — but because theirs is, and they have nothing like this — no in-the-moment scripts, no calm guidance when they're frozen.

The crisis cards work for any cognitive decline — dementia, MS, stroke, brain injury. But I focused my research on dementia because that's where the need was most urgent, and the tools were most lacking.

The app is named after Kerry, my partner. Kerry and unity — because carers need community, not isolation. She's steady when I'm not. She takes her time when I want to rush. She's the kind of quiet confidence that makes everyone around her feel like things will be okay.

That's what I wanted this app to feel like — a calm presence when everything else is falling apart. Not panic. Not judgment. Just: "Here. Try these words."

I'm Gavin. I'm building this from Scotland. If Kerunity helps you, I'd love to hear about it.

You're not alone in this.

## Accessibility

**Headline:** Accessibility

**Body:**

Kerunity is designed to meet WCAG 2.1 AA accessibility standards. This means:

- **Large, high-contrast text** — Readable even when stressed or tearful
- **Screen reader compatible** — Works with VoiceOver (iOS) and TalkBack (Android)
- **One-handed use** — All controls are thumb-reachable
- **No time-based interactions** — Nothing disappears or requires quick response
- **Works in low light** — Dark mode optimized for late-night use

---

**If you encounter accessibility issues:**

Please let us know immediately: gavin@kerunity.app

We want this app to work for every carer who needs it.

---

## Share Kerunity

**Headline:** Know another carer who could use this?

**Body:**

Caring can be isolating. If you know someone supporting a parent, partner, or loved one with dementia, they might be having the same 3am moments you are.

**Share buttons:**

Use native Web Share API where supported:
```javascript
navigator.share({
  title: 'Kerunity',
  text: 'Crisis support for dementia carers. Works offline.',
  url: 'https://kerunity.app'
})
```

**Fallback for desktop:**
- Copy link button
- Direct email link

**A note on sharing:**

Some carers feel ashamed about needing help. If you're sharing this with someone, it might help to say: *"I use this app"* or *"I found this helpful."* Knowing they're not alone can make it easier to accept support.

---

## Send Feedback

**Headline:** Help us make this better.

**What we want to hear:**

- Scripts that helped (or didn't)
- Situations we haven't covered
- Anything confusing or hard to use
- Ideas for improvement

**Quick feedback:**

```
How's the app working for you?

**A note about privacy:**

Kerunity works completely offline — but to send feedback, we'll open your email or WhatsApp. This is the only time the app connects to the outside world. Your message goes directly to me, not through any server or database.

**Or reach out directly:**

📧 gavin@kerunity.app  
💬 WhatsApp: +44 xxxx xxxxxx

I personally review every message. — Gavin, Founder

**A request:**

If Kerunity helped you in a difficult moment, we'd love to hear about it. Not for marketing — but because building this can feel lonely too, and knowing it made a difference keeps us going.

---

## Support Kerunity

**Headline:** Help keep Kerunity independent

**Body:**

Kerunity is free, and it always will be for crisis support. No ads. No data harvesting. No paywall when you're desperate at 3am.

But building and maintaining it takes time — time I could be spending on paid work.

---

**Why we're asking:**

Most crisis apps are funded by venture capital, which means they need to grow fast and make money from data or ads. That's why they track you.

We're trying something different: building slowly, funded by carers who value privacy and want this to exist. That means no investors pressuring us to compromise.

But it also means we need your help.

---

**What your support does:**

- Keeps the app free for every carer who needs it
- Funds new features (audio, translations, more situations)
- Lets me keep building instead of returning to other work
- Proves ethical, private apps can survive without surveillance

---

**How to support:**

```
┌─────────────────────────────────┐
│  ☕  Buy me a coffee            │
│      One-time, any amount       │
└─────────────────────────────────┘
┌─────────────────────────────────┐
│  💛  Become a monthly supporter │
│      From £3/month              │
└─────────────────────────────────┘
```

---

**No pressure. Genuinely.**

If you can't support financially, that's completely okay. You're already doing one of the hardest jobs there is. 

If you want to help another way, tell another carer about Kerunity. That means just as much.

---

**Thank you:**

To everyone who has already supported, messaged, or shared — thank you. You're the reason this exists.

— Gavin

---

## Thank You (Post-Donation)

### Full Version (In-app or redirect page)

**Headline:** You're now part of this.

**Body:**

Thank you. Genuinely.

You didn't have to do this. Kerunity would have stayed free either way. But you chose to support it — and that means more than you know.

Building this app can feel lonely. Most days it's just me, a screen, and the hope that somewhere, a carer is having a slightly less terrible 3am because of something I built.

Your support just made that hope a little more real.

**What happens now:**

Your contribution goes directly toward:
- Keeping Kerunity free for every carer who needs it
- Building new features (audio scripts, more situations, translations)
- The unsexy stuff — hosting, tools, the time it takes to do this properly

**You're a Founding Supporter.**

I'm keeping a list of the people who believed in this early. When Kerunity grows — and I believe it will — you'll be remembered as someone who helped it happen.

If you ever want to reach out, share an idea, or just say hello:

📧 gavin@kerunity.app  
💬 WhatsApp: +44 xxxx xxxxxx

My inbox is always open to you.

**One last thing:**

If you know another carer who's struggling, please tell them about Kerunity. Your support keeps it running. Your word-of-mouth helps it reach the people who need it.

Thank you for being here.

— Gavin

---

### Short Version (For Buy Me a Coffee/Ko-fi confirmation)

**Thank you — you're officially a Founding Supporter.**

Your support keeps Kerunity free for every carer who needs it. I'm keeping a list of the people who believed early. You're on it now.

## Founding Supporters Wall

### Concept

A warm, celebratory display of early supporters. Not manipulative social proof — a genuine acknowledgment of community.

### Display Options

**Format:** First name + last initial + location (city or country)  
**Example:** Sarah M. · Edinburgh

**Privacy options to offer supporters:**
- Full display: "Sarah M. · Edinburgh"
- Location only: "A supporter from Edinburgh"
- Fully anonymous: "Anonymous"

### ⚠️ CRITICAL: No Toast Notifications

**The original design included a toast notification showing new supporters. This has been removed entirely as it constitutes a dark pattern (social proof manipulation).**

**If you want to acknowledge new supporters:**
- Send them a personal thank-you email
- Show confirmation only to the person who just donated
- Never show it to non-supporters

- Video demo: Bundle as MP4 or link to hosted (requires connection)

### Assets Needed

- [ ] Hamburger menu icon (gold wireframe, 22px)
- [ ] Close X icon (gold wireframe, 22px)
- [ ] Emergency icon (🚨 or custom)
- [ ] Hospital icon (🏥 or custom)
- [ ] Heart icon (💛 or custom)
- [ ] Warning icon (⚠️ or custom)
- [ ] Lock icon (🔒 or custom)
- [ ] Accessibility icon (♿ or custom)
- [ ] Video demo (15 seconds)

### Fonts

Ensure all fonts are self-hosted or system fonts for offline use:

## Changelog

| Version | Date | Changes |
|---------|------|---------|
| 1.0 | Jan 2026 | Initial content draft |
| 1.1 | Jan 2026 | **Post-forensic review:** Emergency contacts simplified, medical disclaimer enhanced, menu reordered, accessibility added, privacy strengthened, support framing improved, toast notification removed, grammar fixes, GDPR compliance added |
| 1.2 | Jan 2026 | **Our Story corrected:** Kerry is Gavin's partner (not someone he cared for). Story now explains how Kerry's calm, grounded personality inspired the app's feel. |
| 1.3 | Jan 2026 | **Headline fix:** Changed "Named for the calm in the chaos" to "Built by a carer. Named for my partner." |
| 1.4 | Jan 2026 | **Full founder story:** Added Gavin's carer credentials (Mum with MS, cognitive decline), why he pivoted to dementia carers, and the naming explanation (Kerry + unity = community) |
| 1.5 | Jan 2026 | **Scope clarification:** Added "works for any cognitive decline" paragraph to align Our Story with About section. Changed "they have nothing" to "they have nothing like this" (legally safer). Changed "building something" to "building tools to help her" (clearer). |

## IMPLEMENTATION PRIORITY

### 🚨 CRITICAL (Must Fix Before Launch)
1. Emergency contacts — use simplified 3-tier design
2. First launch flow — build 4-screen onboarding with mandatory disclaimer
3. Medical disclaimer footer — add to every crisis card
4. Menu reorder — emergency contacts to top
5. Remove toast notification — no "just became a supporter" popups

### ⚠️ HIGH PRIORITY (Strongly Recommended)
6. Add accessibility statement to menu
7. Add GDPR compliance to privacy section
8. Update "Our Story" grammar
9. Update "Support Kerunity" with funding rationale
10. Add content review statement to Important Notice

### ✅ MEDIUM PRIORITY (Good to Have)
11. Add age guidance to Important Notice
12. Add competitive positioning to Privacy
13. Add data retention explanation to Privacy

---

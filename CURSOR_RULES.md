# Cursor Rules — Kerunity

You MUST read `KERUNITY_CONTEXT.md` before making any changes.

## Hard rules
- Do not add visual noise (no gradients/textures/fancy shapes).
- Do not reduce font sizes or touch targets.
- Implement motion ONLY if subtle + calming + respects `prefers-reduced-motion`.
- Do not add dependencies unless asked.
- Keep `/web/index.html` as the main UI file unless explicitly told otherwise.
- Never introduce medical advice, diagnosis, prescriptions, or panic language.

## Working style
- Make the smallest safe change that improves calm + clarity.
- Prefer single, clean patches.
- Always preserve accessibility and contrast.
- If unsure, propose 2 options with tradeoffs (don’t guess silently).

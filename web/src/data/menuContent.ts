      <h2>Crisis support for carers</h2>
      <p>Kerunity helps family carers supporting someone with dementia or cognitive decline. When a difficult moment happens — at 3am, in the middle of a meltdown, when you don't know what to say — this app gives you words that work.</p>
      
      <h2>What we offer</h2>
      <p>• Practical scripts for real situations<br/>
      • Words you can say out loud, right now<br/>
      • Works completely offline — no internet needed</p>
      
      <h2>Who we are</h2>
      <p>Kerunity was built by a carer, for carers. We know the loneliness of these moments. We know the guilt when things go wrong. And we know that sometimes, you just need someone to tell you what to say.</p>
      <p>You're doing harder work than most people will ever understand. This app is here to help.</p>

      <h2>Get help in three taps</h2>
      <p>Tap a situation. Read the words. That's it.</p>
      <p>Everything else is optional.</p>

      <h2>Want more detail?</h2>
      <p><span class="info-highlight">Tap "Listen"</span><br/>
      Hear the script read aloud. Helpful when you're too stressed to read.</p>
      
      <p><span class="info-highlight">Use feedback buttons</span><br/>
      After each script, we ask "How does it feel now?" This helps you navigate to more support if the situation is getting worse.</p>
      
      <p><span class="info-highlight">Works offline</span><br/>
      Once installed, your phone can be in airplane mode. This is crisis infrastructure, not a cloud service.</p>

  privacy: {
    title: "Privacy",
    content: `
      <h2>Your privacy isn't a setting</h2>
      <p>It's how we built this. Kerunity collects nothing. We store nothing. We track nothing.</p>

      <h2>How it works</h2>
      <p>• <strong>100% offline:</strong> The app runs entirely on your device.<br/>
      • <strong>No analytics:</strong> We don't track what you tap on.<br/>
      • <strong>No accounts:</strong> You don't sign up or log in.</p>

      <h2>Why we built it this way</h2>
      <p>Caring for someone is intimate and exhausting. The last thing you need is another app harvesting your struggles for ad targeting. We believe privacy should be structural, not a promise.</p>
      
      <h2>GDPR Compliance</h2>
      <p>Kerunity processes no personal data. If you contact us via email, that communication is handled by your email provider. We never see payment details for donations.</p>

    title: "Important Notice",
    content: `
      <h2>Not medical advice</h2>
      <p>Kerunity offers practical scripts and de-escalation techniques based on established dementia care approaches. It is not a substitute for professional medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.</p>

      <h2>When to seek help</h2>
      <p>If the person you're caring for shows sudden changes in behaviour, confusion, or consciousness, or if you are unsure whether a situation is a medical emergency, call 111 or 999 immediately.</p>

      <h2>Content review</h2>
      <p>Every script has been reviewed by dementia care professionals. However, we cannot guarantee outcomes. Every person is different. Trust your judgement.</p>
      
      <h2>Age guidance</h2>
      <p>Kerunity is designed for adult family carers. The emotional weight of the situations described may be distressing for children.</p>

    title: "Our Story",

      <h2>Built by a carer</h2>
      <p>I'm a carer for my Mum. She's had MS for over 40 years, and now in her 70s, she's started experiencing cognitive decline. The tools that are supposed to help — Alexa, calendars — don't work for her.</p>

      <p>While researching tools for her, I realized that dementia carers face something even harder: the 3am moments, the aggression, the grief. That's why I built this.</p>

      <h2>Named for my partner</h2>
      <p>The app is named after Kerry. Kerry and unity. She's steady when I'm not. She's the kind of quiet confidence that makes everyone around her feel like things will be okay.</p>
      <p>That's what I wanted this app to feel like — a calm presence when everything else is falling apart.</p>

      <h2>Help keep us independent</h2>
      <p>Kerunity is free, and it always will be for crisis support. No ads. No data harvesting. But building it takes time.</p>
      
      <h2>Why we're asking</h2>
      <p>Most crisis apps are funded by investors who demand growth and data tracking. We are funded by carers who value privacy. Your support lets us stay independent.</p>
      
      <p>If you can't support financially, that's okay. You're already doing one of the hardest jobs there is.</p>
